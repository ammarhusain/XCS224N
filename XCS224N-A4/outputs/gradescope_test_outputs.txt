So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we will have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the future of being dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the making of medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that we need to take away a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart disease, injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you even are likely to know people to know the <unk>
And so you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you must ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number we need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And it must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a <unk> and if it's a fault of somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only from 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> and what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help an person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, injury or other <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability at 300 to slow down my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects? Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 have effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out by the drug that will help you the drug.
I'm not saying they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> healthcare is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
That's how 49 surgeries for one person has <unk>
And side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you have lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before time, the questions that you can pose to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longest life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is they shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly -- it could be the lunch lunch.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thinking as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> are going to be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the door, a very easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be able to be able to be able to get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French warning language came over the decade in 1800, and with the time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years old.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, are really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following blind -- their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound of you?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my password and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen the <unk>
So I've been learned, for example.
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure that the covered in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
They will go on to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the self with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of <unk> and while I was going from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that would be called the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come in my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only happen through the ears.
I can feel it a <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could give it to me.
I chose to make it <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and the identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for your voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could do it in the <unk> and I don't have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect all the meaning of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters -- different <unk>
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so, while the piano hits the piano is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a key at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a concept of course or <unk>
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters, <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the sign of it is <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through your music?
If I had to create a sign and you would take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it on.
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you know, the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how you express the time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present one is closer to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of your hands.
Now we're going to do so much in my head as well as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a <unk> is a visual tool to help communicate in all of cultures and the language of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest. But they bring very different meanings,
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to learn how to learn how to be able to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove -- and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I became older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good for cleaning the other.
Time time -- now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats as well.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> labor <unk> so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children were getting a lot of the robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turn it light and light cameras on each other, and they put it into a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the chunks of plastic floating through the sensor whereas the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of plastic in the water.
I had this step-by-step invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even further.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm going to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well kids.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and you see it with this one.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also of brown colors, and when all <unk> is very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be built through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
I would have this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote way to help other children.
I'm going to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and the French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons of 300 tons of <unk> in the Pacific floor.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it looks safe and it's blue.
Well, it's a little more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the crash and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to get the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data and we discuss the data and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized an civil expedition to the nearest nuclear power to date.
We are approaching to a half a half a half miles of nuclear power, and with the aid aid of the area we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> of sediment as we invented and build.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technology.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit very small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the biggest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal and chemistry, a little bit of biology, you basically can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new self-driving cars.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens scientists, creators, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so you can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically <unk> design.
One is made out of thousands of steel from a single dragline <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I thought to.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that is struggling to be free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all the information required for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world done from parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects like <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act mainly as a filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that develops its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right -- analytics and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in the simplest level, it tries to unite these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and <unk>
You probably ask, why now?
Why couldn't this do 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of students.
We design objects, products, and structures and tools and the tools of large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour diameter of diameter with a foundation that one day not very far to print out <unk> buildings that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient architecture and has created a screen where each self is size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> on the cells -- I'll show more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-tech <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic <unk> a chair to the very comfortable structural chair and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and in designing this <unk> surface pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to addition to other material or other <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious <unk> but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and get to define a lot of what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and twigs, sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the Earth did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material -- the kind of material of the tree of the tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> their properties, we could generate structures that are <unk> in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a bunch of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> marine concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures of the scale, a system has built a system with multiple <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and create these structures made of one single three material three, a hundred percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it to find a natural shape to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process they used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of communication, and if it extends even more to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for <unk> objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own board of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made by <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new basic basic memories inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us to <unk> these bacteria and that they would make their function of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, we would get the properties of the material in the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to make more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes for 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life within their clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are everyday <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the contaminated tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer print it in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture in which it was <unk>
<unk> is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first becomes the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, paste a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a foreground and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> these silk worms are up to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates -- we could shape the stark silk without just boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we added this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making bone, and we put us on our site.
We knew that the silk worms are going to be able to replace the darkest areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light, and the heat, <unk> silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We wanted to <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full full full of empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers have to unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of us, which demands us for the first time, for the first time that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked English, the <unk> and art and researching the Web in a band of punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, gets to <unk>
And I have to give it on.
But then I was fascinated by something else, something totally different, and I was scared of it, and I'm leaving myself to <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, not all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made it so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be multiplying or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have put me back then.
They were able to do yourself, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you did it, they learned from culture.
You ask us to first ask me, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what you would do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to provoke cute responses in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
I had the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is a question over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise before it takes us sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream about what they might be, doesn't inspire dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are doing it <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> and <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But if you are somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up your curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for that.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the bottom of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
You know, any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of challenging to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe that you have to win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on about a data visualization about data, and I was mathematics and design, when they started <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of its unique <unk> and <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we were <unk> we were <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a girl named <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the highest sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write the compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end you were <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of other videos, other web designer designer -- sometimes a consultant to Kickstarter, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take various <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> magazine, defines adaptability as the most important ability for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they are a pressure to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, and we need a lot of complex problems, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The knowledge can dive in depth and putting ideas into ideas, and <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that will engage with how we're wired.
And sadly, the <unk> in a large part of them are told to be just more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart, you know, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world to us.
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> the led to a psychiatric drug in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had been, I would have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has achieved a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer for HIV, for HIV, and so much more.
But it's been done by treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the probability that your years is going to spend their years with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or wanting Alzheimer's disease.
Already only in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a rise of five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or <unk> or even slow down.
We do understand less than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people knows, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, Alzheimer's Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to <unk> a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease is significantly deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds like origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds all right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
So you have to find the right step that we would think about it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have shrunk and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, <unk> chemicals, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when I test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that are <unk> between each of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they were <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from overcoming Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on government, industry, <unk> about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to progress in HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the victims hidden, caregivers with their loved ones day and night, they're often too much <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
And I took this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, do this.
The paper is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and in my own experience I try to test it one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strange <unk> to make 36 questions, increasingly personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number three: When was it the last time you had to go to another person?
And <unk>
They are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to get to your partner what you like from him or her, I know really honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, the assumed that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was a <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column love to tell you a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, they keep in all right.
And the reason I think I'm asking for this is because I have done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before he was published the article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that was a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But he had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night at night, and since Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday, I had already called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the paper received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing in order to make it <unk> on personal experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or he wrote what they did every day for weeks, they were doing the same question first, they are still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the sentence, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were the students and journalists and <unk> strangers like this.
I was interviewed by the radio and the <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
I read TV interviews, and I took the <unk> orders of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> from the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it really was, if I was able to produce love -- not only an adventure, but love love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 more questions that <unk>
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Rather than that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, between college students, using what they had, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants felt more close after doing that, several more studies, they were also used the informal protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people from the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person who is <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she only wants us to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
They found that they did get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to virtually all my life and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went to the science.
I was doing everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I only did for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems to be really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel such bad and used to me like that.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what you can reasonably demand me to me.
What I'm looking for love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wonder when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the means about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that is still still together?
And your content with an answer of whether or No.
So more than a question, <unk> we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with the things -- and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's a year ago, a known one, a known one, and we apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are still <unk> and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- I mean, love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at him now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no way that I was supposed to be thought of that choice, not what that choice was.
I didn't look at the number of times we would have both to make that decision, and how many times will I have to keep doing that choice before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answered, 36 questions, have chosen to love someone as generous, kind of fun and to have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I did -- and what I might have to spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy implicit ending in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised in full <unk> and in a certain way I became like a forest <unk>
A time ago in New York a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details forward.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box -- and I took a bill of a dollar, a pen and a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's got fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going to ride and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> when Agnes launched the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to the bees and it was <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: in some way it seemed to grow up, as if it was that it goes to the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, strange bottles that I was going to find on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow up to draw like drawing the same thing that is done around a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, let's be able to get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great. man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I would <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the <unk> layers -- similar to the drawing in a window, and then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work came up with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a great measure in "The garden of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double <unk> so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also kind of a <unk> species.
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while from the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail <unk> a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail has a fire <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye balloon.
They've been <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards for the terrorists.
It brings me to the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years six years to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material whether it's <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together.
And you can walk with each other. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> your chest is <unk> <unk>
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that you can cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some of the pills that come out and enter the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> as the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick of brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a farmer, a musician, a musician, a <unk> <unk> a museum, a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
And we took the box and all the people in the inside of each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box in which it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has no effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
You take a pill that is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will be able to be able to be able to effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take these drugs -- they serve the amount of viruses to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the capital of cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects in their negative side, because in the time that it takes to the current current -- you can get worse and worse, even because of the time that it takes it to its destination, which is where it's most important in the HIV consumption.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't really go into the blood stream of the patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, viruses can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a living treatment for life managed by <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> make the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for facial wounds and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for anything <unk> including shipping for drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close to immediately cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are saying, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little <unk> laser beam on the cellular membrane on HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even counts, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, the drug releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence in violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent involvement in nonviolent participation.
I do work work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all of the conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between state states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed fight and policies didn't be <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980's, <unk> also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military system.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
It's multitasking
They were able to make a complex machine <unk> radio stations radio channels, websites of Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the print <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising tax <unk> but by using <unk> business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else else -- create more strong ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put their professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that has no security and security state.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan was torn by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can be able to be able to understand the efforts of these groups for delivering security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, safety has a high death price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 with Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at groups in the West, we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by the government, and emerge as armed and political groups participate in nonviolent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, we can actually behave as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They are part of an territory, and they run all of their functions, they collect the trash, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, in nations without state and hybrids and the more weak states are states, like in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap in no government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in <unk> tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and putting the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will better understand what incentives to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors not <unk> military power can win some <unk> but we won't give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum of security, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive at a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid they're going to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was amazed as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking a lot of self-esteem and dare to believe that it's like or a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and cannot imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They had the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it as easy and accessible to contraceptives and services and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need of <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to figure out our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, and skills and much more.
We need to have to see these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- all the volume.
Though the letter degrades the women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin and yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical beliefs.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but they also kill insects, the collection of grass and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of the fairy tales that make it true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, and he agreed that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are going to be vulnerable to the <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically needs of the needs of the women of color -- the gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for white women and high <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist a very bad feminist thing.
It's also the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that they were doing perfection.
When we were <unk> <unk> very good from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a fear of what that tag is in fear of fear -- not to be able to accomplish a little bit of realistic expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
Over the last few years, it's a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this star star constantly constantly thinking feminism and to know the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud to be proud.
<unk> the time -- the cultural critics started endless arguments if <unk> was or not a feminist.
They took his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go far beyond the sane critic and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The evil self or more well, one more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to the day, will go to action and be a little bit of <unk>
If I listen to music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change in fact affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions is, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years old.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
They were going to be overwhelmed by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option was <unk> as something easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sports -- <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than they are <unk>
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish your magazine, engaging in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help be even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision decisions.
We are no longer <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in the power and producers of cinema and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create significant change and significant change.
We can also tell you with courage our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> says, <unk> is a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I mean, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
Some guys were telling me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I read my voice, and after all of it I don't think I could say something that might be able to matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave other woman I could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I argue the overwhelming reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having been exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the controversial issue of autism and vaccines and <unk> and caused by being a fraud <unk> by British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world continue to be <unk> that vaccines will pay for their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism rise in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism considered a very weird disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her thought about it creates all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising as <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnosis, and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who searches in the face of her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark parts of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed to be <unk> private, private, private, <unk> <unk> to the people around their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were accompanied by the panic by <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
By the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, he declared that I'd seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he realized that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to her office by being autistic without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, they have been very carefully held in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records and he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were simply <unk> what they had to heard their parents would be desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers began to test <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought that the theory of the mothers of <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like black-eyed without special education, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend by the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years earlier.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
They set up a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the fact of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in autism was a lot more <unk>
Some children couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realized about these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he spoke German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers a alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with art classes with music, and the kids followed their games in the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability to life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic like patients, Asperger's I called their little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education methods that were especially good for them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of relatives and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> known as the pop-up social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond there even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 80 and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> and <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one broad and <unk> model.
These changes were not in broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked in between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance performance -- <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network, a perfect storm <unk> of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> they were expected to be expected to make the people with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> a very powerful, powerful, <unk> history, as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate estimate of the center of prevention than one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right -- autistic groups are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that these are puzzles for the new advances -- the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it is <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a <unk> <unk>
Indeed, autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that creates the <unk> for the most primitive aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
