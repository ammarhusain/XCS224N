You know what I do is write for children, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you know, in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is usually something that fell into a place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird thing.
When I went to race every week in the men's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the years -- I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we are never getting to know us.
You could get it to Ohio -- and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to ask you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it one place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from their family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her from.
And you know that part of life needs all the rest of your life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this today.
It also needs -- it needs -- it needs to be a dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> a year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall from glaciers or <unk> the ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't get more and more <unk> in a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that they're isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As you melts a <unk> I'm breathing out of your <unk> atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts, it releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come back to me to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and won't be going to exist in that way.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
And part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a iceberg who I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to get to witness an <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an average of Greenland, average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day at the same moment, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception I don't get paid attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and the life starts.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground with two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am a <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people are <unk> the anatomy -- to say, human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that performance works in my work is the activist, as a <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics challenging social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins, two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology is not fit into male and male <unk>
In general lines we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't exist in the common forms or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> which is <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on a course of <unk> <unk>
When the baby <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And so often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the federal period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After taking tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually have testicles and a Y <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, as men, as men, we have in the body called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- he doesn't know his structure -- I think being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the more exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with the testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life like a guy and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had bacterial chromosomes and in the uterus -- the areolar glands were so active that in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component of the male component of the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with experimental chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- that are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries is not to be able to have any physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why we get to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our own social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy of anatomy has <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> to be black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children are born like two people within a same body.
The highest point is last year with the <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such one that we have to have a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go to science, more we have to admit that these categories were going to admit that these categories were <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than they were doing.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we come up in science we get more and more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but we know within the <unk> of when someone considers it dead.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved not to do it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs, from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of actually figuring out the death of someone. And this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about me.
So let's get it from the concept of a democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent one of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every bit of looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the fathers <unk>
The parents were <unk> -- to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they did was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents were, <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The case of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power was going to be being passed by the right of the blood of the grandfather as a parent and then the son, etc.
The parents -- <unk> rejected that idea and replaced with a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game of play, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences. That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were born.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear -- if you look at the story of the Parents -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving into a concept of <unk>
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talking about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the female <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement and said, "I'm a man."
And again, people in the color that will be <unk> the <unk> difference about the <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to go to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five years of five years should be allowed to have sex activity, or to get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term, was born June 1, 1980.
For only it had been born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sex -- sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now to be a <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his part, it doesn't have the same rights as a marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science was going on so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman to get married and <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests with people to get the people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> they go beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks great.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
So I want to point out also that I'm not sure we had to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent <unk> <unk> and <unk> about their sexual relationships than 40 people I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me ask what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to <unk> unless it's willing to be willing to meet a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done a couple of years ago that had made <unk> <unk> and then pick up their fame.
But when I asked her the phone of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, he's considered the political <unk> instead of the separation of <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as you might have been, if we had more participation on the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from studies in fact, is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> as I considered it as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there is no female <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, the more I've been thinking about it that there is something else on the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the brains and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it is possible that we would have given more <unk> to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we improve democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family is to think about where it wants to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city they want to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily address the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just took it out of cardboard buildings.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments were already owners, and that the other half is still not going to be able to do it.
They could try to increase the capacity to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you think is that those buildings and the areas that around them have rules that are rules to avoid the <unk> and the fiber of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, and build a whole new apartment building and always again, and when the rules of that will be able to build it rather than building <unk>
So I proposed that the governments -- new education areas for big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the following election <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where <unk> reforms and the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and treated all the residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need both of the technologies like the rules for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us going.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going into there and an option for people to choose to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going on.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I came up with another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a option for a city to which you might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from distance to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the government leaders of <unk> would need help of <unk> countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with the countries that will help them set up and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily <unk> a thousand square miles.
And so shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to create these special developmental regions.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress to favor this constitutional constitutional constitutional <unk>
You know, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 passed over again in another voting -- from <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting at the age of 24 to 24 of February, a <unk> shift was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the middle of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after that was four years old, getting the <unk>
The other interests in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and you're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last one for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders who are very interested in the project.
They even can get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've been solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that would want to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends, <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, perhaps, and most recently, photograph and publish my blog and <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothing is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> shops.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go up to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My look like <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I love <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks by TED in <unk>  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger dinosaurs.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always be phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the <unk> including the <unk> I had <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be a bad mood, when you're wearing a bright <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't just get rid of you, you can also get rid of you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you have inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner place, and the outside of the outside, you don't look like you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you need to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, and <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical thing.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So, where does your brain do at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not a mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need quite a pretty logical logic on <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A little bit of intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is that one thing that says one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar of a parking bar taught a beautiful lesson, and that is that the big things they don't allow the <unk> and that they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you will be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things really weird -- as they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they call it a theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I didn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why I shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a very big focus to the small <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> with a shape of springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip chip. And I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming hole that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs some help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward you might be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people goes up to leave those things, because I don't want them to hear it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> colleagues are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then they gave it to a temperature of less than a degree above the absolute zero.
Now, by being only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it was moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way they were <unk> it was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and that we didn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that metal piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which it means that all the metal piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you you too?
I mean, it's my part of the logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics will say everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head and my head is here and allowed me to get her.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were doing it with 17 very interesting museums for nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining to just this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better that shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> gallery, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the New York museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very straightforward.
We click and <unk> we are inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
They continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> question.
If the museum shows us the image, click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click there.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get from 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and even deeper and see you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we will quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this little <unk>
It goes up and it really makes it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can actually create your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The Power of the <unk> -- we just made a dive around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium is doing justice to your work of art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is, "You can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a quarter of Formula one, and I took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the air.
And as <unk> are beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note story is, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but it's 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms were going back and <unk>
And that is changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end took the hammer and threw it up to Moses -- -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said to him, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- so what don't you do?"
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and make something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy from Italy and France, and at the end of <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity would happen in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night, everybody went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everyone <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things -- as you can see, things that are all going to be done.
Then we put a little chip, and we put a little chip on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
And after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
Are there complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we dropped on a day is still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we will be able to promote some change change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague from MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, that came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels up, you can write on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And by zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
It liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows -- but when you get coming up with you that you can make it happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've got it, but when it's low almost all the architecture goes down.
This is actually working.
You see the people who are <unk> by what's inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not be able to prove the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opened up to leave you -- but a building that was still making <unk> and holes and water and one had to jump down to <unk>
<unk> noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, that moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
So a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal brand in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is the light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, in the one that you can zoom in, and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet today, the star of New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as a entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can travel all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, the first time -- and the Obama campaign. We can go through the digital world of self-organizing power, of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but <unk>
You can move through the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, serve to share the main moments of 2012 Olympics.
So it's a lot of the physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a matter of changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better way, will be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and make ourselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are you most passionate about.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you could <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of us, that makes me feel very well like a doctor.
If you could have some of this -- the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a glimpse of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense of <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, very well on one end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been perhaps 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
They realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin resilience, but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of the pancreatic improvement.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the other bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want no effort to <unk>
It's really a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> to the output.
But so, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first moved to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two little daughters.
But when the multicellular organisms appear things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I was getting more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of it, you find a wonderful dancer <unk>
He looks at it and he says, "You know, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, George says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different aim for the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to save us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets that are designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily benefit to longevity.
They don't necessarily react to the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even more smart.
Evolution encourages the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean in the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish -- fish -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look at the phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the reasoning reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it's no longer possible to have the feeling that evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a species, the distant planets are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a very positive and intriguing possibility.
So I call it <unk> the new evolution that is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it takes to individual and family level.
So think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex in your own brain, but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Genome started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could get the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three million base base base of the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and in one week.
Not a lot of free to make the human genome for <unk> and becoming more and more and more <unk>
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine -- in a plant of tobacco cells.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, to eliminate diabetes, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce changes for preventing diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get them with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to make the evolution of the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can give them to 1,000 years and maybe something happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these options in a better successful society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, and more robust, and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good time or for worse, and before what you could do, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before I died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I want to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
And the second thing I learned that day -- and this is while I <unk> the George Washington Bridge that I wasn't for a lot about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason -- <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it's not afraid of fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a small kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason for being in the world.
At that point I understood that these two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the ability to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying up today, the challenge you imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please don't be so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is it that you don't expect to do because they think they're going to live by <unk>
How would your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to her home after he run and said, "Dad, feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has a total <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I saw Stephen <unk> -- not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone saw the film "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate from that way, they are <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I met her with her brother and her father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the Tony <unk> is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner can't <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research who has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer to draw over that and register the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First of all, they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much move things from one side to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of safe companies and we get a machine for <unk> could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was we bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and when they were born, they would have taken the walls out of the walls and in their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> walk in my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper copper and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up one -- we published the code -- the software is low to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There were all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of computer programs all night, Tony came back to <unk> for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture, because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital parking lot.
And he went back to the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking feeling.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and he would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
So in some form that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it is the equivalent of one <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to go and do it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the most best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of Los Angeles in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now -- if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It was in <unk> and hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days of just eating this fun -- a fun thing in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that would make interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing a way that was really useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come up here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of 2011.
What I was doing is this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content I could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said this, this is a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I would not have been done by certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to do it for something that difficult or as dangerous as entering the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever.
What happens in "The largest film ever ever <unk> is that all of the top below, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the X-ray.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people would be thrown into the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> You know, <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark in the title, but we're going to make sure we're going to use all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we get a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe you ever have.
The most great car that you have led in "The largest film ever ever <unk> the best <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this movie.
That's the full idea of it, all of the film to end.
And I would love to help you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people there.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: One and a half a million and a half thousand <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it certainly is worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be.
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: So it means you're not very optimistic.
So I get <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> meant to have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people as it could be possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this one.
There was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> or easily <unk> or easily <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line or the bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it actually it changes all the time.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that is still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie -- and that's him looking at it as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the <unk> story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wants to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away from my team.
So what I started to think of all of a sudden -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant movies, and others who make small movies like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies say that the reason their films have so successful it is because of the brands they are being associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever.
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want you to tell you how to <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a little brand.
And we would get to the type of little movies that <unk> are more well a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind you to people is the reason that this is why this interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: models.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new.
I think it's a big word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It is really cool.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those of the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk>
<unk> Something unique -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, many gray colors and things like this.
And I usually wear <unk> like sunglasses, or I like the <unk> and the same.
Woman: If Dan was a brand of a brand a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of it <unk> partly <unk> in <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is everywhere, because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Uh, <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> it was often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could walk into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality of <unk>
If they were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how your thoughts and feelings are your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you get to you, like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and how to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> why is that?
What is <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be <unk> What type of mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thanks for your patience. <unk> Great <unk>  Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies only fall in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid the things that are not <unk> but they are afraid of fear of fear, those elements and you actually train them and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is Dr. Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands that things that have gone and come on, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your design identity, your design personality -- what would be?
Are you a <unk> attribute you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or you're rather a <unk> attribute of it.
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful will be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or audacious like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical as <unk>
Or you're rather than attribute <unk>
You are a conscious, you are sophisticated as <unk>
Are you traditional established, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have nothing to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they are now using magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire for the brain to be a commercial marketing as a film.
We went to St. Paulo where it's forbidden advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there is nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting the way into schools with money issues in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or where I've had the most successful answer that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> <unk> took their agencies, and they said perhaps these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was launched in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was launched in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media to this film.
This covers just a two-year period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, or TV or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about to their customers will not be part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that on those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people of that is pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees in the loss of risk is preparing all their company to get rid of rewards.
I feel that what it has to happen to happen is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that can <unk>
Ultimately, move forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to stop transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization -- the Foundation, Foundation is a check for <unk> to be applied to my long-term <unk> for the next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Its biggest active to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are completely different.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer for an engineer to set up this gray, box, so we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to investigate <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That was called attention, and we started an experiment where we started our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they came up with very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then of dealing with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is an active box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it's actually working on that way.
It doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You better have to make the goal soon.
So we pulled out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two square bombs -- a little bit and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would take all the points for those to attack.
You probably have to know how much we did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language.
I want to tell you how we could make sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage them with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white asset, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and asked them to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the small digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can get it, and even making the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was that slow and <unk> in an obvious amount of effort to go back to the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
So the results have been used after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would mean to one single and same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we really saw -- really <unk>
There's the gray, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> to the operators in the room room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open vacuum tubes.
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And I don't have the <unk> or the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better that we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done a lot of public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main thing behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower engine.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you some <unk> skills or another one to make users of prison chairs and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that gets up in the morning, gives you a big force -- which is also increasing your speed, and help for example, handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, you have to carry on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it's going to be able to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take 90 pounds of land for many hours.
Its flexible design, it allows you to put up in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> movement.
I mean, what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs on the wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the world's population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people who are very young, with damage in the backbone that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that gets up so fast so quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago he had a spinal cord injury and as a result was unable to go back for 19 years, until now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board here on the back.
There are some batteries that give you energy to the motors on the <unk> and the knees, and they do it going on with this soft and very natural ride.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole feeling and all movement from doing it down.
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So my mother stole me to the last bit of hope for my self.
The technology of adapting has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> <unk> and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but how do we all of the chairs of chairs to everybody.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the so-called <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the rainforests of the Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest closest closest life.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done so much emphasize this in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where political violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforests -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage on a violent conflict that has been over for decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation make you cannot fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo shows the <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human relationship.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game and I don't talk football play.
Here's a female and a young woman in the middle of a <unk>
Look what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just believe in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in bonobos as a human.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds, and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> the most of our capacity to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans forever, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems as appropriate to play, it can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
So for that, fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are invisible to a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came to the captain first to the captain and he asked him to go up and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live alive because I was five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get to the house.
I need to <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, and I went to the fire firefighters that at that height or less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures for the owner of home where, as he expected, his treasure got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as my calling as fireman is a witness of the actions of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they're because of the <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give up, you know, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room -- <unk> a neighborhood.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big line of the concrete block.
Early blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules that fit in each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used <unk> unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He called him a <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 and 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the printing block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small little unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> bricks stacked with each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the printing block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex, a brick at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally didn't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're joining together.
So you can't get wrong with the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with one green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green one produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We would have this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or more slow, you just spin this button that makes the pulse of it faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything needs to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light from night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers had no experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who had no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something else.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> barrel for motion.
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to the scope of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
Nuclear collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I get a term for time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> they worked with the <unk>
His task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
And it's a fire caps in Boston.
So here it appears as if I was looking at a quote, but what it really looks like is that somebody has to clean up when it's caught by snow, because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and that moment was <unk> a lot of last year.
They realized that the city has never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk>
When you do it, you put a name, in this case <unk>
If you don't, someone can do it.
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest one of the 21 applications that happened last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends viral.
A responsible system in the city of <unk> <unk> to see this app that they could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people would steal the batteries.
And so he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that were using using it.
And this has been spread out of <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know this doesn't normally happen yet.
<unk> drug acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best school for their children.
Then we told us that it was done by the normal channels would have led at least two and side of two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the inner power of California that until the time has over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that is program in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral way, is a kind of shot warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like business companies like a lot of people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the open form and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to apps <unk> every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
Do you feel a lot of frustration before that, but you don't have the <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do is we don't have <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to ask it, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government at the last instance <unk> <unk> remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to get them to <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly a matter of <unk>
This is the telephone center center and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of your house, and put it hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New <unk> <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually gets this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I walked into the place, I found the cube garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I gave the <unk> I went home.
Good evening <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to sustainable voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology to platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get married and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will exceed our values and we need our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
This is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which holds us out of that that we financed as something that we operate in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us that have been <unk> in the government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on the <unk>
We can't do with government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is that with technology is possible to rethink the government of the government so that it can be expanding to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be, they're all going to talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't care a lot to do to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set out the work to program applications that make a better job to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be wiping out a <unk> taking out of it, <unk> a garbage garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumer consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all the present, when it's about the important things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of your hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here has impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we see fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you're taught with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all of the discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
He was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery was <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I was like, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I would come up again and if I told him yes, I left me in peace.
I had this human quality that I'd always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that it had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and he said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. The two will <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, "I will tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never want to <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the middle of the middle -- I have a brother and a younger year and one sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just had the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> the <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
He went to the face with force and <unk> "Oh, it's not going to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to everyone else who really doesn't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't think of being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
There were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the U.S.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black are so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 to 60 of all young people in prison are in prison or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
It feels interesting.
We're looking at a few of us at some pretty good work on it.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, I can tell you about rights for always if you have an criminal detector.
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has absolutely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before he <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where they were 13 years old, to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance of getting over.
We are now in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They get people in death row by death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for obese crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent and liberated from the death row of death.
An innocent rate was an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't allow you ever to fly airplanes if in every single nine you would have a <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classroom with students on history, <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that it lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot of this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined little bit of terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you could not overcome the segregation without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany that I was talking about death penalty here.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we don't have death in Germany.
We will never be able to take it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get in the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we would put people to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we didn't really care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But in the day, those realities are <unk> by suffering, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my mind, we need to integrate both together.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> which will never come to TED.
Think about it it is, in a way, something that's inside our self.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so engaged in intellectual and intellectual <unk>
The development with creativity. The development comes not only from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas from <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This <unk> connection with the heart is what drives us to look at not only the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to the technology and design that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty to the <unk> to inequality to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> and we're going to bring ourselves to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
And so she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's get me telling me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We're trying to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death penalty ...
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger in the face and said, "This is why you have to be too much <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst thing that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
This is not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual and rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich rich rich, but by the way they treat the poor, they treat them.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really deep issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge will turn to someone in what's not it?
The judge would take him as an adult, but I see a child.
One night, very late I was awake for God, if the judge can become something that you're not, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
And I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black client was treated as a <unk> <unk> white <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been some conduct behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical store, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up with that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had the <unk> but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got in the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came off the car, walked into the court.
I was going up the stairs when I met the stairs when I came up with a <unk> black man, was the <unk>
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I am a <unk> he said, "It's you?" I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I was looking at the ear, in the ear, though.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this brave <unk>
And I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started walking.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen all the crowd, the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. We all talk about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
And I would just look through the window and let me hear all that <unk>
And I was walking around here and for there.
Finally, this old black, with a face of concern, walked into the room and sat behind me almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over the old black people.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, "You know, this room of audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view in the target with <unk>
I have come today to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds to justice.
We can't really be human beings, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, in this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a number of close opportunities to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in <unk>
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases didn't <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that it was <unk> these funds to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who do it like this?
<unk> actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this growth is dramatic in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does not do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've been excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> This is just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second one day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And like nothing else matters to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us.
So from a <unk> of stories, <unk> look at the negative.
That old saying to the <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us the negative news you give us the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is wrong with worse than the world.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what really happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress made in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the scarcity of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income is <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy has gone from 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, many of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, <unk> television, mobile <unk> mobile and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So let's get a lot of this technology, and now the exponential growth of this is.
My good friend Ray showed me that any tool that we had to <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing is -- in good and bad time, in war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> are called infinite computing and sensors and networks, and 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, digital medicine and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the better headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think to create abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each other's <unk> is about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> from the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops who ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington is from aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like the <unk>
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
So let's get this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet by <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents in national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed <unk>
<unk> a famous photograph, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, and two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen -- this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a refrigerator race.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> saltwater, water -- contaminated water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just assumed that I'm going to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have full confidence in which I'm going to be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation, by this technology that today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the Reagan President 25 years ago.
And to have a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video -- images of books and music, technology technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best one is going to come up when the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, Foundation, which is the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device with which they speak, and because he has <unk> can be <unk> you can be able to be extracted from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a medical medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this <unk> device, a RNA or DNA virus that we don't want to call the health and the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll move from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What a <unk> What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of using 3D impressions and computer in the cloud to be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three million more members of human humanity, and healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never <unk>
What if we give the chickens everywhere they are, a voice to be heard and be able to do for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
One thing I learned with the X award is that young teams guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do things -- things that previously could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up with a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've been playing with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three million new minds that are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do.
We have a bunch of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as well as <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a underwater.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were about 20 percent, the <unk> <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose to the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this kind of <unk> <unk> was called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South Sea South China, and mostly in the Sea of <unk>
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of <unk> about <unk> remains of coral reef.
In short, the sea fund came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then the commercial fishing begins.
The bottom of being a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
I once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to do it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what collect fishermen every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there was no <unk>
We don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point to start, at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you will, this happens something like this.
On the x-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, a lot of killer whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal, and I extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end of the end, I keep <unk>
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal which is very unique before <unk> it's a little frequent <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose wild animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With the time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain such as captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the protected protected areas, we actually visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle States people -- for example?
I think the arts and cinema may be filling in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> a <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are making viral and what important it is about.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today the online video makes any of us or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of these, you viral gets a myriad of visits and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> of design communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popular summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow long.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video to the popular.
The creators of the so-called Jimmy <unk> gives us new things and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
RS:  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start a Friday.   You all want to get it the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday. <unk> a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be coming from nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, on Friday <unk>
Well, it took a <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a drug creators group embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big little joke, then it starts to talk about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike <unk> entertainment in the 20th century, this communal engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's it. That's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three hours version that has seen four million times.
So even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script could you have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video -- just a minute, only the only thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't really interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was blown away by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that keep you flying off the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million and understood his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do.
And all of this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend and creative communities are totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new type of media, from a new kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners from our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- they're just the current media features -- but we would have the entertainment entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one of the unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for a long time, friends, now I got it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and an <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to <unk> the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for she who couldn't do this.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat attached to the sea as the ship <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the plants, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was carrying a <unk> with poison.
So if we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I know I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he died, finish the journey was too much for him, and the first apple who tried to take for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of class class, whose population is comprised of immigrants in the population.
Unlike inner-city class <unk> whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the dark English fragments were <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> who was usually <unk>
Two school pairs for school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform until <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me are <unk>
I was stacking up determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were scared about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> kids were going to be trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical <unk> student, relentless with what I think of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- increasingly, by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people got help through the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected the young Australian young woman.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't <unk>
As a resident lunch resident was now as <unk> refugee and activist and invited to talk about sites that I'd never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about nothing.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother and two daughters and two daughters just end up the day for almost 20 years old, <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
The "no" had ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What won't be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more I was to talk to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what we were doing what we were doing. living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown -- a little bit again in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They had no longer been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
They would be able to get a small group of people for the <unk> who can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant array of soup that all <unk>
They were going to do all the time overnight.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some bright ones, and we opened up <unk>
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and he would take the cause and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
You can't make it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, one <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother named minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories, and we ensure that we were still with it.
At night, a <unk> came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life built us now we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I ask myself about the ship.
Who could want that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, <unk> brave in each wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the British singer, <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car, <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
So in that time when I was <unk> the great prince warrior warrior <unk> I was <unk> out of an arc and with a <unk> on the ground, there was water.
We are now doing the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was going to give me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
And I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to do not <unk>
As a girl, my grandfather gave me a given silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how it would use to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book, you can see it.
Where do we are.
They collect the text with the image, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But why is that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --   says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I read a character of the book.
In several moments I got a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that I used from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we need to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a girl was that a whole galaxy was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag up to this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of a fantasy condition, there's always been maps but a static maps.
This is a map that grows, and you drive you through the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and a contemporary way.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras, for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back into a little child story.
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you need to go out outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images from different natural objects.
As a girl, I had a lot of <unk> from <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So in order to recover this whole ritual of childhood you have to go out and in one chapter, <unk> a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This is a digital collection of photos that then you can put in the Web.
A boy from London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction in which you get out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside of the home.
So at a point the screen is full of leaves with leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology is coming to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and to that magic, <unk> and child love that we sit through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and closed machines.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that I need <unk> or any urgency of that style, but it would see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people went to them from their homes, taking their blood pressure, they will go to their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, get back to recover the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the <unk> care costs and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video video.
We all have the controls of navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made it <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, it already opened up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to go on a global level.
We are <unk> to all colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us to validate these <unk>
Could you be a messaging service or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that cannot take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera -- the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by the press <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful in the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the standard of <unk>
And when I say yes, I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it seems to be captured in a way as a photograph as a photograph.
You know, we will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if I came there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually in combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like a picture, I think it's those ones that don't even affect the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs is very important to them, because otherwise something else is going to look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to continue to make realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect life.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that we find because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a <unk>
And yes, I even made the red house on the top of the island for more <unk>
So to get an realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and at the time very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing one slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
This is a diagram any one I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details, but the general look like.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other things that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step of this represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here's something going on.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
They were more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves in <unk> scales.
The answer is that if the draw on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve would be very dumb to see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transportation of transportation -- as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's unprecedented in the history of technological development that every few years risk orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- look at these <unk> curves.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it will be converted to a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition now.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is, what is that new way you adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that transition might be, how could that transition that you <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time where I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a few two billion years when the Earth was a big broken rock with a lot of chemicals that are going around them.
If we see the way those chemicals organized us with an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, it had just floating with some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those blobs of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made these materials out of the outside and so the drops grew up grew up grew <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe in chemicals.
And every time you were <unk> <unk> a chemical distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that in some way is becoming better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals and more chemicals and <unk> more.
Often they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and a very simple chemistry, but things were <unk> when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our recipe is exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> we can see things with this code.
Here I have a 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card personal card -- I have a lot for all of the <unk> in fact, for everyone in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming like cells.
I don't know if you know, bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to be able to get communities that in a way, were together in that way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up to become so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community to board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage is interesting for life to take another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities in many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The cell of the skin is not good without the heart of the heart, or the one of the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more than processing information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being responsible for <unk> structures and understanding the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism can, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because I knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen in the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit of fruit that they ate that fruit in love.
So the fact that the nervous system actually built these information structures enormously challenged evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea <unk> in your head.
I'm here sitting emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now went through periods of similar periods of organisms to <unk> our donor methods and presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
They already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced certain evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took a few hundred million years.
<unk> the language and so on, took less than a million years.
And next one, as the electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess I suppose, is the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms we work for <unk> would not be possible without recent technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that information machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers, <unk> designers, we think a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you don't can, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the occasions.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please go for a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions.
You could run these sequences of random instructions to run all those programs, and take the ones that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order these numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to opening numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a random sequence of <unk> <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, it was able to put two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
They would get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we need the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and that children will be able to get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that were a little more successful programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
They were doing some mutations at all.
And it tries to go back and forth with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are written by an absolutely perfect basis.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
They are quantum programs.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they were able to do it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment of analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we are all part of the creation of whatever it is that it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I got to <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time enough to let me give up some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat my talk, I talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be out of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 from a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game of game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the first base to the first base -- not coming to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know how to call a 300 <unk> <unk>
Well, actually, well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who was 10 strokes, hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the Mayor <unk> <unk> in running more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I think about this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are attending a surgeon that has also a record for 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and one being dear to have two arteries have two arteries <unk> and their family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think of you must be the average of a heart of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is to send me to the world, and I would include the failure of being perfect.
We never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
One time, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman school was a <unk>
Maybe which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my <unk> class, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the fork in every artery that comes out of <unk> the frequent <unk> and not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you were doing everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist to go to that patient to me.
And you report to the chief of residents.
When I saw <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both side -- what <unk> me and <unk>
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I was going to do it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
He gave him <unk> <unk> so that it could eliminate liquid out.
And within one hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt great.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes in it.
He sent her home to her house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring information up.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to do a lot of constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He sent her home, I didn't have any attention to a voice in my interior and say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so insecure as he asked the nurse that he was giving the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said that he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up, and the ambulance together with the ambulance guys took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept following my job.
At the end of the day, I would stop to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do the normally, I don't do something that I don't do.
I went through the emergency room to home.
And then another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady who was born before, but another one. He told me three words -- those three words that most of the emergency medical physicians were going to be able to <unk>
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "You know, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the time of an hour of having come to her home, after I gave her high school, she suffered a collapse, and his family called the <unk> the ambulance who brought the emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 centimeters, which means a shock of severe.
I was just breathing and it was blue.
The emergency staff will get all its resources.
They gave it medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and waiting for all hope that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at ninth day, he left her go. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
So the weeks later, I was fascinated by that, and I experienced the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, <unk> not feeling that healthy shame because you can't get your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The shame shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very wrong in it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was we were wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made an error so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on a day <unk> he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I was wondering if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I took the efforts to be perfect to be perfect to not make any more mistakes I would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was a <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he would stop here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> shift my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I spoke the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient he saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can Google it in Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, he didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics through it, and they recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the E.R. I don't <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were getting to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned normal. A colleague who was checking the patient to some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand side, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk>
I checked out and notice a certain sensitivity on the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant have been over the last five years.
Be embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how to share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- it would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> of mistakes.
This is the system that there are two <unk> which are being made of mistakes and the ones that don't know that they can't sleep and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies who begin to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you bring into medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a bad medical research research and medical mistakes to learn how to do it from the first article that I wrote for the first article I wrote for my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are going in in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right -- in a system that <unk> infections, are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they are killed by 24 Canadian medical errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not getting the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is spread every two or three years, and we don't get rid of us.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in his chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breath alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals likely to error, well, not anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk> cases.
In my <unk> <unk> white, art, <unk> is a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance and the head of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> and they will go down to go down, <unk> and <unk> and they started telling their stories.
They want their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The surgical doctor is human -- the human knows they know it, they accept it, and it doesn't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving fashion.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they will be able to be mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am a human, <unk> errors.
And I feel a lot, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose a half American American, it's about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research on a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> of these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only about 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of you know how many of an hour?
How do we take the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to choose to do in the order of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water -- and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why I never bought nothing?
This is the oil shelf from <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box, which came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different different classes.
They put a place for <unk> right at the front store.
We put out there <unk> six <unk> or 24 flavors and different flavors and looking at two things: First of all, what people were willing to stop to prove <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of the ones who stopped when there was only three percent of the people who were going to buy <unk>
When I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we make the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have <unk> -- <unk> less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the prevalence of options are affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this doesn't get us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding will available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program -- to save people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rates of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of you who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in the market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to be providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing to do is it <unk> the decision that <unk> even when this is going to be against interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though it sees it better.
The main reason is that we would be able to look at that giant <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, and to choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so you can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is more than today, which is more than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be a <unk> increase the costs -- there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden corporation eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that fewer <unk> are increased by <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know it's known to fit today, on average, providing 45,000 products.
In a grocery store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better options is the name of David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a life fund of life.
People who really want to choose them, you have 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people to this audience on a vacation with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give them an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anyone who's ready to accept the supply.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first turn, than on the two, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the problem of the choices <unk>
To people understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very much very <unk> very concrete,
Why people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting that we were looking at exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we would tell the staff to think about the positive things that were going on in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in the shelves <unk> throughout the corridor of the <unk> the exhibition in magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of people to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This scheme of classification is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something to the <unk> not when the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
He meant who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think, if we only get it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that allow it to be <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
You know, we had four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> by 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to do?"
How involved you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you are <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
What we found is that those who go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice is not saying anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways we make it to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can manage more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter I had to write to the government.
You had to register a text of an example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were a written written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is going to be <unk> freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer, you buy any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer to print a page, that page will end up having a few little printed dots on each page that follow a pattern that you own from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to win a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it through illegal media through banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our key cards to get information from our cards when we bought a computer <unk>
The secret of the U.S. is two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> It's <unk> you know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, and they motivate the protests, they motivate them. opinions, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous has been <unk> in the last 12 months in the last 12 months of a single role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous and the last group is the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> from the Netherlands or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall last fall because of a <unk>
They gave the safety of the site and presented a <unk>
Last week, I asked him at a meeting with the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if he said, <unk> the death of people because of the heart attack.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except to you -- a foreign <unk>
And that we were saying <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters at the headquarters of the secret police headquarters on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And inside that folder was notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a huge scale the communications of citizens in the country.
They had been sold by 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters of the company is right here.
So, Western governments provide the tools to governments to be able to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the government officials to investigate its own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond that.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's on play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we can do today, will be forever.
They are going to be blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to the park.
And predators, like the lions -- and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and as soon as we get to us in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only message that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
<unk> are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they also are mad with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it was even helping lions see the pen of a distance.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were -- but the second day, they came back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So you jumped in animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the turn to turn off and off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
They would take everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box, makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights are going to be thrown out of lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the homes in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
And she had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to freak out other predators, such as <unk> <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants elephants in the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International International International International International and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them.
So a year ago, I was just a little boy in the grasslands, of the <unk> <unk> my father, and he used to see flying planes and told me that someday it would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting that is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on the other electrical building.
What is the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence near an CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that it was already invented by electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: I heard it once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every single step that <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little boy, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea is the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I spent all my life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public job.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten it in the last two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead in the street, holding a kid in her arms by looking at the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
No one would take them because they were very concerned about them and their families.
A huge famine went to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> the <unk> of energy, all around me was completely dark in the night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, at all.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee accident.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it also dangerous, because the North North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was blown away at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they made a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to the other, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And he left me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum.
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Though there were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans did not have so much lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to leave, many other Koreans haven't had so much lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be tested in a moment.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be an opportunity going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South it.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call <unk>
Although I went to life in South Korea that was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and, as he says, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location of a distant location in the <unk>
They had to run away from immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to get them in a way, for more than three thousand miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a police officer.
He asked you all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all of my family to release my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison in the South Korea.
I was going to come out between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a saying, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money to my family and for another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why would I be <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to be able to get it to the most.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people who are born.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I came together in South Korea, and we met in South Korea.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices and practice practice and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with family in the inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Texas.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the city planners come together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Southern South order to represent something else, so they changed the South L.A. -- like this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.   <unk> <unk> food, <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a food desert, the L.A. Center to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that the food places to get people kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying from heart disease in Los Angeles Center in South L.A.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I saw chairs of wheels and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to run it out.
I said, "Well, I can do what come on wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was like I decided to be able to run it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we set up and we started to plant our food meal, <unk> trees -- you know, the nine fresh vegetables.
What we do, we're kind of a <unk> paid group made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me, and at <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my yard, the <unk> became made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go.
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story written by Steve <unk> and I spoke to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the United States of America with more <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on the hell don't it really like this?
We had a plant to give 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern <unk>
I grew up there. It was my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Just like an artist <unk> who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It turns out to see what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> from looking at the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my yard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "You know, people will go to steal your <unk>
And I say, "Of God -- no, I don't fear that you go to <unk>
So that's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was a fabulous thing to see how this changed it, so it was just a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming in, work and <unk> all of the volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this will be taught if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, eat blind in the front.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see color kids who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys that are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my reading, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take it and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about.
I'm not talking about free, because the free thing is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work with people, take the streets of the street, who know the joy, and the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You know, the <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Prize.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you can <unk>
And especially if they go on the <unk> and these cars go up, that's not really nice.
In addition, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands -- very close to cities, you'd want a quiet road in the city.
The solution for that is to make roads.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands -- has pores and water can happen through it, so all the water rainwater flows into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get water without more.
The noise will disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you can see that on this road that the surface of the surface is out of it.
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> Is it ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see what the damage is happening in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it's only a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> to the <unk> light -- this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting of steel, from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel knitting into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is make the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
I used a <unk> oven because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
So we tested a lot of samples out there and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We've got to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> highway, where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of this road and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of charge on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fiber of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even you can increase the life of the road, you can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how they look like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News in his little gray radio radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at time, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> "My father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget it.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and they made the girls illegal to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister -- that I could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we two could <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so it looks like we were shopping at shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us locked into a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we had our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead, the school was suddenly suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters had a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> where his daughter, my mother, and it was to school, and so his father would <unk> him.
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is it.
He went back two years ago, only to turn our house into school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate his children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated with our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want no <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the school, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate me in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who drove him through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global automobile <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition, <unk>
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I arrived at her home, they are the phone, a voice <unk> him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her their own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would argue that these changes wouldn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, which <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
"I never have forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> he resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the Tunisian revolution was inspired by the downloaded of mass <unk> so much from the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens going on inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men -- young men -- they were in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown an act <unk> by dealing with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead, they were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have wanted, with many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and just to democracy and national <unk>
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a <unk> enthusiasm began to organize workshops about development development and skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the Women's Women's Women <unk> a movement of women, leaders, of very <unk> orientation leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right of participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, a little bit, the elation of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made up for a revolutionary mindset -- and it became more than the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today to deal with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and <unk> with selfish policies and <unk> both for men as for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the elections, which only is the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the architectural depiction of the female more than needing the representation, <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it <unk>
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also putting the mercy in practice rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition -- the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to end up to the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran -- <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that involves all the humanity that men and women, which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
This is what it tells us, "My mercy takes all the things."
So it tells us, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They were all telling us the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a religious question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the question that you all do the same thing. Why is it left?
Why would anyone be going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul -- <unk> to my head with a <unk> with bullets from bullets from <unk>
The man, I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> <unk> where they fall every year of millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have an MBA at Harvard Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have about 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the race, all of the religion, all income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody believes that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration of the duration or said in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect or we would expect to find a reason for which, domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be left with a man who comes to him, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> me.
And two things.
The first was that he had just had <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and that seemed like a <unk>
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made it <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- that I was ready to Harvard, I had been to Harvard, I had been a passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done.
And it was why <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do anything for your partner, and so I was going, I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical trap. and financial and psychological psychological trap.
The next step in our domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to <unk> had to feel so safe it was bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> kept under the pillow in our bed and third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause out of the trauma that lived from small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never met my hand, my life was really serious for danger, every minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was confident that we lived happily forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they would form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would make any more harm.
I spent two times more on our moon, of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in my head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon, and he was driven by traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> continued to take one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women are the victim of domestic violence and <unk> at some point of their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
So I'll go back to my question: Why do I tell me?
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, and in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why simply don't <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question than people do, because we victims, we know something that you normally know is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has gone to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who had <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go to me, because of a last <unk> <unk> out of my denial.
I realized that the man who loved me, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone to the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family and family and family, and I am here today, because all of you will tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as headlines as headlines -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people that's a way to say "The fault is <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and they would take their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am actually a victim and a survivor.
I got married with a cute man and kind of like we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever gotten to be a <unk> gun to my head in someone who says I want.
So at this moment, the same people are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting your daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives on silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
We need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They gave the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
We had the mathematical signs of violence in order to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe way.
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and secure them should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have been dressed like this.  luckily, I brought him clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to do it now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything as my head covers me.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've been totally changed what I thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he <unk> her back and <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan as I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm a model, because I'm
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
And I always say a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have it associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to take advantage of making money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some lovers who are <unk> Hold on. Hold on, <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we need them to know so much about models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- to say, less than four percent, they were not white ...
The next question that people are always asking me is, would it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about it.
But then what I would tell you to each one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon.
If after this list, I still get <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the American journal <unk> or the executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you be higher.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get out of your studies, and you have a trigger and a few jobs on your backs, no matter what you want, if you want to be president of the United States -- but you want to be president of the United States, but the people would look weird for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that <unk> me and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time yet.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
So I wore my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the Buddhist magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those pictures.
These are <unk> of a group of professionals, and <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is: "Is it for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I never use, except the first before, but the privileges I get the privilege that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a grocery store, and I forgot to take money, and I forgot to get the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and of course <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent so I could keep <unk>
I think of these privileges for my view, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for what they are.
I live in New York City, and the past year of the teenage <unk> teenage girls who were told and 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It was how many times I was <unk> and <unk>
When I research this talk, I found out that by 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with smart creative people, smart and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my view every day.
And if you ever ask the question, you know, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair, the brightest hair, but probably the most <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to keep out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was doing enough enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos -- and I didn't have the <unk>
There were no directors, directors, or no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, and even a minimum amount of care in lighting.
In fact, most of them were taking a random tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He gave us back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take us through the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of getting the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So, we weren't aware of how much of the life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only to the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in my dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> store, which was <unk> in the previous visits of the previous term.
And he described what had felt like five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York City is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So, I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the photo, and I don't want to get to someone and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why have such a bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs -- as a famous stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and the laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World World, that are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank where we have 16 species, from these 16, 11 with a high risk of extinction.
So why are you going to know why <unk> are important? First of all, they provide vital <unk>
They're our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that would not be because of them would stretch and have huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge significant importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and <unk> Egypt.
On the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> to open <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of another <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being heard, is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> the communities <unk> use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically endangered list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian use in India and they've taken a statement.
Since there's no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge <unk> of time to <unk> The number of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so focusing on a living problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we have.
How can they help? Can you become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do -- my life has been <unk> by seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And he was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would expect.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and and <unk> and and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were excited to come to work, and sometimes they're not going to do --  -- we were aware that the local in such fertile fertile century, couldn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking how it was possible that it was possible that it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a tomato ball would grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought it's only for us the Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, did what the American did, what the guy did and then see what the guy were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that we would give to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of different culture.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The small is <unk> written by <unk> who said for especially economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> on their own.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at the age of 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you're never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have a dream to become a better person.
So what do you?
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We came up in a cafe. We sat down at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years old and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once you get to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they will kill them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never be told in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they're not attending your public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, which is involved with you in their house, at the table of their kitchen table, and that helps him find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> Western Australia ...
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
And so I got up and <unk>   So the government says, <unk>   So the government said, <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most great business student student in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before we get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> said Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of death of the traditional spirit.
So now we can now be able to see what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to give you that you have to give you a <unk> you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you're going to get it in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community for 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation you have to talk about is this tomorrow?
Young people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossil <unk> <unk> and at a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There aren't the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a remarkable story that I read in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year I came together -- this group of people came together -- and they figured out about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would be no longer within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would bring in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very <unk> <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you a absolute absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company, the largest company, has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and search for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't born.
We've looked in and looked at the 100 companies in the wrong world, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in coffee in bars and to their malevolent dedicated people who will do for you, what somebody made by this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what would you need?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> it can be <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those people around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we're not going to take a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> and templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect on our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries of centuries and I trust them in a city.
And there's a <unk> in New <unk> there's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest abandoned properties.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and it hurt.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led me a profound gratitude for the living time.
He gave clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I was trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to let me catch up the day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die, I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die, I want to get more and more."
"Before I die, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes and hopes they made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It's about giving the reflection to the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I began to get hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been made up walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of citizenship that is increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and <unk>
Cancer is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our space spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
I don't speak, but it transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares <unk> it happens what will happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice on this: it has never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even be <unk> it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but he remembers the year that each of the songs came out of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit the concept of ordinary society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- even though they didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing that were <unk> autistic people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> are so different for Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the most fast development disorders in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have on <unk>
As it was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I would have wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I would not want to change by normal.
The wildlife goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact that they are different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic people or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave a kind of communication to medical engineering.
I was scared.  They were really afraid. from these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when he fell through the hole of the <unk> and he saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with students. It surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our largest challenge, from energy to the environment and health care and health care -- and if we don't know what we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't just tell us that they study <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making dumb things.
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said, everything as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
They can actually communicate your science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of finding it and <unk> with their content.
And when I introduce your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by what they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk> bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but that is supporting too much in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing graphs that we would bring to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were doing.
I think these are just a few key passwords that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English <unk>
Because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who seeks a public charge no matter whether you have a <unk> platform or <unk> and that, when he won, it gets the mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament. enabled the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end of it had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's true.
It's not. It's because of a freedom advocate of expression.
But to really show you how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how George Washington, his leader.
Didn't you know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they didn't even have it to be <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And I could have <unk>
All the world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be empowered by power.
They didn't want to call it King if he did it or to her <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> and more <unk> title of them that came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. I had existed before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were dead presidents of little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with a <unk> and <unk> degree as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama has a kind of following there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important, and this is what I want to tell you, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound just as modest today, right?
Especially if you have over 5,000 nuclear warheads at note, the largest economy of the world and a floating fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, appearance -- well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to give you to you.
Now, politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually actually change a lot more than words than these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in an illegal <unk>
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak about it, but mostly that cacophony of male <unk> and <unk> stones with primitive.
As such, I carry an cheap flashlight of light <unk> I strapped on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the branches of branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole in the ground.
And I took my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and fell <unk> on that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep time of that hole at the risk of their own lives without paying any reward and, often, dying.
And I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it because they're accompanied by slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents -- and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace of <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who's done to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to such grade.
When we end up talking to me, I felt very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got a <unk> <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
I even considered it my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans during the whole point of slave slaves to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
However, today you can enslave entire families by generations of high-tech debts on 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education promises and better work to find out that they are forced to work without suicide under violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met <unk> <unk>
This strange show is like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a very heavy forest of <unk> empty spaces, bricks in their head, to 18 at the time, and they take them from the blast furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment for these people.
Back in the blast furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> I don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrating emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you no direct help.
You couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship from that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his liberation and he trusted that he was going to be able to <unk>
As to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children dragging stones for miles of <unk> to <unk> to trucks that they were waiting to down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy, than the kids who were able to get them and kids put them on their heads with <unk> ropes made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some of them don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with the <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the toxic <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word, slavery often thought about sexual traffic and because of this world awareness they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk> sex.
It took me on a little bit of stairs with a little bit of stairs that gave this basement <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution,
They have small rooms in rooms -- private, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and to <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer abuse of their hands of customers.
On the <unk> I remember having a <unk> fear fear and in that instant, I barely could imagine what must be caught in that hell.
I had only one <unk> the stairs where they were born.
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a topic, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual <unk> is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the blue <unk> of the blue and the red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, that we can go out of this house and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen in a boat, two older women, some younger kids, it makes sense.
<unk> were all <unk>
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> and forced to work <unk> their own boats on the lake, despite not knowing to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to the water.
The branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and in fear, it goes to water to release the branches.
A lot of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
In fear of his love not going to run and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the youngest slaves under her charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the last one of the networks, but they had been working on the last <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village for fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of slavery.
Kofi roots is possible.
Who will come to be because of someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her suddenly <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it through a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that we put on the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was being done by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as they were <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> ended up <unk> in one of course and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field -- and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children strapped into their back, and while they were looking for gold gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in his own <unk>
I remember I looked at her tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet, and these people carry these people carry on top of stone bags that then will be shipped to another area where the stone would be able to extract the gold.
In the view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the corner we see the other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
And he died his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt.
When I met her, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he has been to be liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to testimony to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're real people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math applied and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like the management immunity.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the <unk> dancers -- that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand for an extraordinary degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a certain <unk> <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease destroy gradually this extraordinary ability, like it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, it was a ballet ballet ballet dancer dance.
Over the last few years has done a lot about treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we'll know if there's actually a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there is no <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials -- they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic what if patients could get the test for ourselves?
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a really conventional way for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone as healthy as it emits sounds when we can imagine, as you can imagine as a ballet ballet ballet dancers because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed.
And like the ballet ballet requires an extraordinary <unk>
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
And from sound, we can track the position of vocal vocal cords as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's disease is also affecting the <unk> organs.
You can see a <unk> <unk> example of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they are both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are low cost, and we all know what happens to us.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears on a massive scale.
These are some amazing simple lists to <unk>
We can reduce our patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for a <unk>
With high-speed <unk> we could get goals.
We could make a massive <unk> for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I do today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
<unk> to <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, you can call it under price and leaving recordings for about cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you can say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or no disease -- TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people may not <unk> you may not have it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this time?
A lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone company as well, what we did -- the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We specialize in the dark rooms with no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin is still more perfect -- we do the impossible, and we would be <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11th of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May <unk> traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The recorded water level went over 24 feet tall and over three miles of land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses in the way to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish from dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those photos represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms -- <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When I look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab of the lab, I couldn't help avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to do it with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came to be more <unk> and they needed more <unk> so I went back to Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we went to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week for the week we use our scanner in <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we think about <unk> is a different story, relies of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour for an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand by hand using the areas whose color and detail had no destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures submerged in saltwater, saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with oil -- all of that next to the time of the time, I continue to be able to <unk> so it was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean up, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos that are already <unk>
As he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had been lucky in relation to the photos.
She had begun to <unk> her same but stopped when he realized that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of a lot of far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would take it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his pictures his little son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been labeled by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean out over <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them came back to their hands of <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would bring to us but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This was about the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone with the past with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger and put something, using their talent to something that are not a thin skin models.
To end up I'd like to read this electronic email -- I emailed the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As we were <unk> I couldn't help but think about people and the stories shown in the pictures.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a picture of my family -- my grandmother, my mother, me and my newborn daughter hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the time our basic needs are <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to be inspired by this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition in one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in the heart of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without <unk> and really challenging the camera idea.
So if I take a laser pointer and switch on and put it into a <unk> <unk> -- in various <unk> creating a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> <unk> <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in <unk> camera.
Now, all this --   remember, all of this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a <unk> <unk> <unk> which starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of photons finally get to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the narratives of the top is on the bottom of the bottle, after various boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current bullet and we make it go the same distance and we see it in slow motion.
One day? In fact, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- or a bullet bullet in motion.
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato table, and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, and I was thinking, like, <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes see a full array of it.
But if you look at one more and more this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> it's still brilliant.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces inside its interior and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in their mobile <unk> they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera in prison?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the low exhibition, it goes very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest exposure than the shortest exposure than we can just get some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> <unk> million times, and we recorded over and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data on a raw raw data, in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what a dot corresponds to what a point corresponds to it.
By projecting a laser you can record a <unk> picture, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's on the back of the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite hard, so actually this is a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new manufacturing framework to solve the problems of testing in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, converted science in art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect each time not just for scientific visualizations but we can see that we can be able to be able to be able to think of scientific experiments.
We create a new form of computer photography and a slow motion and <unk>
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
And it turns out, as we're recording almost the speed of light, we have weird effects.
The order in which the events in the world is sometimes <unk> in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding Panama of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and it can be done by <unk>
This is all possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> from 1984 and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be able to look for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> in search of a change, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
Who of the people have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about me from my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Similar data.
Why is that information there?
Because in summer 2006, the Commission at the E.U. filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European phone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who called <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where are we in.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't get a concrete answer, and it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
They gave up the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly about brown and a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty hundred and five thousand pounds of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention <unk> means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Mexico City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and keep going back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to get a train <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me a few friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicates with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who speaks an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known that I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known that they were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Berlin might never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible as possible as possible as we could and outside the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to play them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not a whole way of fashion.
When you go home, <unk> your representative of its representative because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that came up at birth.
Now, I'm sorry -- I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be a disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
On Christmas, they are at the shopping center, drive into circles for parking lot and what you see?
16 empty places, 16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And also, I mean, I have 99 problems, and the P. <unk> is only one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> se puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters I was <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also going, and if we didn't take away all the top note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk five years putting my <unk> on their feet and just walking.
Another anomaly that I used to be used was hang on a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> I carry on it was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and remain all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think of appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a fan of campaign.
The people that grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that it was enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating it, so <unk> the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or so I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to go through the summer summer on the coast, and I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get them in <unk>
On summer vacation, I often got my father trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk <unk> I got hot cups on the back, I was <unk> in the Sea <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I remember the water <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can see it in the head.
My parents, <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, University in the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the forest <unk> in the theater.
And all of us <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note on my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the glass zoo of the glass <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> Al <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
In order to <unk> it was <unk>
Thanks to God <unk> at the end of a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the theater, crying crying as if someone had killed my cat, and I asked her why she told me that I couldn't make the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave it to an actor.
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disability for disabled papers.
When I sat home, and my first tour <unk> was as an extra person in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> directors were not <unk> actors, were not white, with disability.
They only get perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took <unk> famous <unk> New York City to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he fell at the way I was at high-speed <unk> on the New Jersey highway with a driver who had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us quite fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news program <unk> back with Keith <unk>
And I went to a graduate dance, I was invited to a studio and sat me in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed myself to the desk and not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> and I ran my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never get <unk> from me and even older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite one, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease is it?
We really should pray for it.
A bit suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can't do someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying they didn't understand, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee children a small part of what my parents would give me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child than a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you read a gentleman who offers him to <unk> then for dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new, money to send home to your family.
They present a young lady.
Finally, they eventually get home.
It starts a new life.
It has a <unk>
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky downloaded a bomb.
That boy from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that brought it out of what we call the <unk> <unk>
And their story repeated over the urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the gate of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital -- I was going to get to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had seen it forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some juvenile leaders at a business market.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
And I remember when he told me, that because I was a college graduate college, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white thing for Al <unk> and other organizations in terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely <unk> the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> matches the local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people will be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business leaders.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from plastic to the overseas.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up in civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
They want to create a space where the families, the young families, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So you can inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas.
They need experience and orientation to <unk> in development and <unk>
<unk> young people with the resources they need, they need the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, <unk> is something else that will start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Great <unk> is how it called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and hold the trains for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young in entrepreneurs, <unk> and to eat their innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of the mountains -- a <unk> area in the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it won't be on the way that we could -- we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight of a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple hearts -- yellow paper balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they were doing, who thought it was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and by 11 thousand tons of waste and two thousand tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and he walked through his tracks, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I didn't just ride in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated <unk> mechanical and bar, the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very much <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> to the weight of bringing up on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the world's top <unk> and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and they pass humming around you.
They just want to be <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never stops coming from.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be in movement.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the waste <unk> are the most important hand hand on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and efficient way every day, this starts to <unk> their <unk> and its dangers inherent us in very real forms.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have a space for how new the engine engines begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just by <unk>
And then there's what I call our average average speed necessary.
So with that I mean just at the speed at which we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't care about it, and we don't want to kill us with our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that is to commission it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the waste collection that maybe will help to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in a <unk> way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always remain in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his computer <unk> and I was doing it all <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be good.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate the waste collection and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and have to account for all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste, what we think we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the number of waste in the nation.
This is a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose work is clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
I was a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life in the middle of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and traditions of local people.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty almost empty and have very large shops in which people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> <unk> heat into the interior, so we need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And third of all, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worth being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really awarded the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people are going and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of many stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to reveal the website, which is located in a very much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, attached every entries in the building.
And this goes up with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the open air in the building that would spread through its own shape of sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that was going to go to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete concrete concrete concrete space to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas that were not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall because it was in order to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much, much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only understanding the city of Tunisia, but also to their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I set special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access door connected by straight lines by almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was broaden the streets in existing and creating 12 initial blocks similar in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the things that are strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> and straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we had a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then on the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The ceiling, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as giving the community the space is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can you get up and <unk> and do such as a <unk> of two miles per morning, or to jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of bright hair, and a little <unk> of cute. It was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of cyclists until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at me after the <unk> I was a little evening, and I was sitting in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took the table of my master's <unk>
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings in my <unk> just a little bit of like this.
All of them.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put up all rows of <unk> and myself a row of a row -- just to be there, because it was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I will never get <unk>
But most of all, I was telling me the reason that I was bothered by this little girl, and it was so good for <unk>
I was fascinated by jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of American killings in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study <unk> in all its possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there was no such <unk> there would be neither literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> New high school lists because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We don't have a <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and as much as they have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work -- "In pursuit of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forget about how <unk> it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what a cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious to be the ones that have been reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel shy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make all novelists novelists and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me the other way to give me the other time right now.
And it starts to call himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- that adds to his collection of instruments of torture in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You need to <unk>
And how are you <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the large amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in their <unk> agony of sudden listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with true value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search for the truth, of the truth -- which is what to <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be, which makes us suffer, it causes us to a much more profound range of feelings and vital man than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that we go to search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> tells us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way?
There's some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspected of no cause.
But he was looking for things that she did his wife without realizing it, <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> very well how <unk> are going to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more we become a <unk> <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to do a violent or illegal acts.
<unk> drive us behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me -- I was at eight years old, I am <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which I would send <unk> messages to itself, for a year.
For a year a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What big -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> -- Mr. <unk> books that are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take away from your self and <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> your name, takes your rings, your bank bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the road from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I sometimes wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I always have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, this is so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who would not want to get your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> It was in history. It seems to me this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated like a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be that easy?
What if <unk> are really a <unk> issue just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
All fiction fiction, jealousy.
<unk> used to invite them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the mad Marcel <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> of Apollo 11, 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray surface of the world is the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest performance of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked about 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which went on behind the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why do you find?
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. You know, some ask, why <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would the <unk> <unk>
So 35 years ago, why are you flying on the <unk>
Why plays Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> of Apollo was not just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon came up in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what he Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with a candle -- but in 1969, <unk> <unk> flew over 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems we imagined that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or feed the world population appear to be a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> <unk>
I knew this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I could see colonies on Mars.
So that is that it occurred to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear that all the time.
We've heard that over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists were <unk> and they were enriched with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation that in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created a less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that we were at Intel -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are all <unk> in particular, the incentives that risk capitalists provide entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment of investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated, and deep as profound.
Sometimes, we chose to not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't fix the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources of renewable energy as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treaties -- the development of <unk> energy -- a significant increase in the research and development of energy, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see a major energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure on the form of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or systems for storage and deal of food, but there will be a famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some <unk> of treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need to do it, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to fix the problem: The institutions need to support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, does it happen with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there is no popular science mythology like the way the solar system is exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be easy.
I was only three days.
And actually, I didn't even have a problem at all.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decrease in trust, it's a very general belief in a very general sense.
The second one is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been wrong with <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task -- which I think is a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I turn to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions and that might be augmented in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were arguing about 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still a lot of <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But it's this evidence for enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people feel when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably get to ask: "To ask <unk>
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in the <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real standard of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good judgment of the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid target.
It's not that the aim for me to <unk>
I would have to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Now, I am a <unk> of not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are saving their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it says, yeah, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They are <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they are not responsible for them to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they don't get them in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that they will get their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we're going to do -- we are going to do it before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> I will attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system is destined to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
<unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were dependent on being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that we are reliable and if we want to determine whether other people or government are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in effect, is <unk> because they give us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's because you cannot <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That's every day, everywhere, it makes the ordinary people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can <unk> it without giving explanations.
I carry them up and get it back up the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson at that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worth trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly gone and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everybody.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to the morning.
The designers can wash their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool.
But the two hand remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the Science division division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a <unk>
<unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, now you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
So in these examples, we are going on in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and thought about the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted or <unk> when the system is the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make these physicists so that we can be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my <unk> collaborator Post, we created this only physical knee.
This <unk> magnet, behaves like a space pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
We had what we did was <unk> the gravity and control movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> metal and <unk>
And when you engineer the object, we release it out of time restrictions and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and remain in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically <unk> and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of the times that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, the digital information is not only going to show us something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us that we have to <unk> our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you plot that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my mum said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only a path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would like to work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer from Chinese.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were told, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
I think during the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to find another <unk>
No one to me just wanted to do it.
Let's go to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about American <unk>
And it's not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but it weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It is so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
reading reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research fields as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in life in <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and politics and spiritual ones.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling or powerless never.
Having a dream <unk> it's really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy today living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
And Alex came to the first session with jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw on the couch from my office <unk> and he told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories, <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it became easy to move your head while I had the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> the new <unk> said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after that, and then you start to work later, it has children later, until death happens next.
And I just like Alex and I had a long time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to Alex that I would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe they fall up with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences -- not only for Alex and their loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody comes to age without spending before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see <unk>
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream -- a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the truth of truth matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments that shape their life is going to have been past when you have 30 and <unk>
People in over 40, I don't get <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we would expect.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility goes to their top to 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are time for <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what those girls are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists named <unk> names of <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing entirely happens.
And then every single day, smart intelligent, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not just <unk>
Or say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some time around the 30, it turned the music back and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing I would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but it doesn't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the 30s, and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, pick a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show you, which is a lot harder and stressful <unk> to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career that you want now.
<unk> tells you you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the girls are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which was more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living -- very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she gets up in her saying, "You don't pick your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cry for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk> <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I get <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the 1980's, <unk>
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> race and no one knows the future of work, but I know this is this: identity capital generates consumer capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that they want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration of exploration that should not tell -- that by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that I would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great for you to take you to the airport, but the ones that get together with friends with the similar minds with the similar limit to whom you know, what you know, how you think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call a weak links of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of those guys have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we could get to this group.
Half of the work that we created is never <unk> then meet the head of your neighbor is how to get a work not published not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose his family, but I know their friends.
This was really true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would soon get her family, when he has a partner and in its own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better than 30 to sit through that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choose the person who you live now or tell you now when all on Facebook start walking into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means to be as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it to work or kill time with anyone who gets them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which I live.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> of events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and I sent myself a letter to me that said, "Now the emergency spaces in those emergency conditions are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of the Los Airport Airport coming out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match on its trajectory makes the difference between land or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good time, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all of the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what now I have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, use their weak connections, choose your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to <unk> students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and testing.
I give you tasks.
When I went back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and worst students.
Some of the ones who had better performance had no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure the best way to measure it.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn very fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to be possible in competition.
We studied professors who are working in really difficult neighborhoods, and <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school school year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, and we teamed up with private enterprises, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all of those very different contexts, it came up with one feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, public health, and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for a week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more likely to be even more likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> evidence even the safety of the kids were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little bit that we know, the little bit of science on its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development is <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid ethic at work?
How do I keep motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that the talent doesn't give it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are simply not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, determination is often not related to or even related to the measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing our determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything back with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined to make our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster simple way.
An Chinese academic academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic adaptation.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible, until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms in both side as if I was shouting <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are company, three are crowd.
If a person comes out of your arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It is a general, such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of memory, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember fire?
Two of them together, it gets very hot.
Three of us are a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out of the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, have <unk>
So we've been through almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth's <unk>
This is a sun placed with the start, because Japan is in the east of China.
So one sun next to the start, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one on the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies in the mountains.
Today, the Mubarak has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where it comes from.
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking to and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand in it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live in and raising our children in a kind of industrial <unk> of a child <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> <unk> a girl dressed like her <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician, and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies produced by the computer of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance was <unk>  And so he was trained in the room, and he was just impressed as a left mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
He would have the feeling that Luke is an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician <unk>
How does Dorothy Dorothy his movie?
With good <unk> with all of us and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much force capital.
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that had served me to navigate around the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really hoped that the credit of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what to do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they kids, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal work by teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all the times continues to appear in classic <unk> every one of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and the son, or two men who create a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking about, this year, eventually came <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar, has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost any of these films happens the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had a friend of mine on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to <unk> in the movie, there are more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid who you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> an idea of consensus about what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think it was <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women hide during the Australian crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to take this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's a massive entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistician, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then you charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
Are we <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power to be able to keep their power back.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we need to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've probably read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite character from "Star <unk> Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to say less stories where I'm telling my <unk> Go and struggle and even more stories where you see that their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was I was looking for sea biscuits on the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I began to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that I could see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea vehicles had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the spot, it seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and we process it using fake color suddenly -- the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at are the real chemical changes in the landscape of the <unk> and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Global Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place happens in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk>
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, they moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball gloves using the eyes.
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists who are doing working jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human occupation for human <unk>
Five feet down, under a thick thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date in the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs, and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense occupation of occupation of the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find any <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
To share knowledge is most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED. This was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas were actually happening in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of obese obese in bicycles.
They're competing in a <unk> race and go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door against their doorstep.
There are bikes flying around and wheels that pass on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door, and the door of the door, <unk>
And the <unk> or what the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse talking about.
They can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you see it's about to get in the mouth.
Put it on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing over the center of the center, singing <unk> It's <unk> One More <unk>
Now I get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a wall of yellow bricks and from the oven, come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Lord of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few different ages and different habits.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- looking at them just once.
They have the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
It would give you whole poems in just minutes.
They would be able to see who <unk> the order of a deck of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be an indicator of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques, invented a half a couple of years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches and the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English and bright English one, although a little <unk> told me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards, live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what the potential might be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very much of the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets us see how to point our memory to us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> And he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, a number of treaties about the written memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> wasn't just a thing as well as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that we've changed the cognitive <unk>
As we almost don't have need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College London invited a memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on an fMRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and ways of <unk> found that in the memory champions they found that in the memory champions and different to others.
They were actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is running as an armed race in where each year shows someone with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should be <unk>
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
At his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- which he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
In an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these things, absolutely all the techniques using the end is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It's shown with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I get back later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told her their work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, in reality, doesn't mean nothing for you.
With all the other memories that dance on your head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were doing good when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get to this word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a couple of a thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired like entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party party, you couldn't get a <unk> <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and as soon as the classroom was <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But it didn't only kill them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were granted.
This is how you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single day.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What we were looking at at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good enough to remember names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual and visual <unk>
So if I told you that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> are very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if I asked you to tell you who I was sitting on the horse who was sitting on his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the future of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy idea, you know, <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it -- if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that you're on the door of your house.
And you come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they fly in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they will talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> not a word -- which is going to confuse it's typical of typical people.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase "In first <unk> it would be like the first place in its memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I came up with it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, is how to see a bunch of people sitting in <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone else gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was very funny.
I would never have hoped that I would have heard it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually trying to do is better improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was quite hooked up with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction. is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this isn't the point.
These are just a little tricks.
Because they are based on the very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to build <unk> from the memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete care that most is not <unk> there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I could even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is going to be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so we would have only <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a <unk> and I was six years ago, and I was living there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all passed out watching the television television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and I would all be able to see me and every time I came up with it, and I got back in a towel -- all of me saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> he hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that they are.
And it's not surprising that we feel like this, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you about in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it to be based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection we've used this trick for a very long time for a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> <unk> <unk> front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has this <unk> has this <unk> columns, columns, <unk> -- that they leave <unk> what they <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, value values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So what is possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new new solutions to the current forms of life.
We would build it and we make it so much, that we get completely away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with these <unk> <unk>
So we do it, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experience <unk> we are trying to swing the next back to go ahead and go back and over and over and over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
It's really very hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
I would get the next again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic <unk> could be <unk> to French or Italian <unk>
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated some other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the next again in the other direction.
In the early '80s, and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we've got new design techniques to be on the computer, and we find new <unk> some ways that were being done against other forms.
This is an <unk> and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said it was one of those rare moments when academic critical and public public and general public were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a thousand percent when it finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms, <unk> and <unk> how is it possible that it will become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media would spread around them and quickly learned that those forms meant and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This is the beginning of the beginning of the new research country with other <unk>
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how they use architecture.
thousand years ago, you'd have to have been walking up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 buildings more than knowing if what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we found buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be <unk> because we're at the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to the media, start to swing faster and faster, to be on both of the extremes in both of the <unk> and it's effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make <unk> symbols with emotional payload of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a mode of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by adding these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there is no unique answer to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and beautiful drawings and one is no longer a <unk> public who doesn't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> of red brick based on ideas of what it must be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are going to get rid of the whims of nature and not the contrary.
This means a parking garage, in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to do a sports or to <unk> or even one can be married there at night.
That means three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> in New York, and to raise half a million dollars in the attached community around that cause, no longer one client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more and more intelligent buildings and more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to want them.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them way to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries of households where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned out a year and he started walking.
And it makes it in that very cool way, from the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It gets <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think, When were we doing this?
How is it that we suddenly don't taste our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search on Twitter. "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager only wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow of the school said, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> and <unk> teenager, that receives these answers to one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing movies like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it getting to do this?
Well, teens today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, giving him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been as connected, in a continuous way, so young people <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in your bedroom all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, and it's always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they have.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what it's authentic and what it is rigged for us.
What is most prominent in somebody's life in front of someone in a corporate context, what is normal in a corporate context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls now.
<unk> <unk> zero to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to do with what young people are.
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of superheroes in sports, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we have to convince society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates in class. <unk> participate in the classroom, because they don't want to call attention by their physical ways.
One in five are not attending to class at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're smart enough -- <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China, the U.S.
And it gives you regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
Kids with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diets not healthy that they can take to a food condition.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make more disruptive decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets <unk> surgery with aesthetics, sexual relationships at early ages and no protection and damage damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are <unk> again, regardless of if they have or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women don't present a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed at me when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we must make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact -- but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family and friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to start the key set points for anyone willing to provide a education to self-esteem body education.
One education is a fundamental one, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see it.
And all of us can start by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, "When was the last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and such as companies -- to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing all of their human person, <unk> <unk>
We need to put people that are actually making the difference in a <unk>
So by making a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that go out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where they think they see that they are never going to be aware of being who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you on your mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats out of it, what would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, and he would kill him for not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were able to get this, and it would allow you to unleash the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images is <unk> to everybody.
But let's get our kids true.
So what you think is that the way you see is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because of how they make us feel.
<unk> self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little ones <unk> in a year of age today, becoming safe change agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The fifth of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi leader <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially they were innocent but being a prisoner by the other younger charges in the company, they began to plan attacks on 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily, those plans would be held by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center could not escape it.
Later, I would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American <unk> teacher elementary school. The two did all the way to give me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact with it, they don't need a lot to want to wish the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all of human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that you have to use all the means possible so that they all lived as them.
A few months before he arrest it, he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I played <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a son.
And all of all, the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they thought to them so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be failed to put a van with 700 pounds of explosives in the parking lot of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had been moved by 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone who was a moment of packing and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new of the class and silent class, and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> for <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> it was <unk> to judge people, based on indicators of <unk> like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in my mind, my thinking was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a <unk> victim, almost all my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had done friendship, was Jewish as a Jewish one.
I took a number of days out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and frankly I felt very proud to be able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that I was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job, in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures, that experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and most critics that had seen in life.
Having been a child, a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy to me to treat people at the way I would have to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race race -- religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keeps in my heart forever, while he's alive.
And she looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is going to be able to bring violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way -- that even though I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones. For the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those <unk> acts as the rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
This is an incredible movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie in your own, you and you.
There's nothing to do it more directly.
So at least I know I have a <unk>
I have no sure that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective to objective
<unk> by nature, is subjective nature.
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, we saw that vision.
psychology, studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is studying the brain -- but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to saying that this kind of work work responds to some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what you do with certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No <unk> to <unk>
There's actually no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an internal movie <unk>
At this point, we cannot understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they behave and <unk> the living organisms all are all questions about working target.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we are talking about, how we do <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that everything is being accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that would work. For a long time, I was hitting the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness of physics that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
By the other hand, we don't know how to fix that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness right now is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know how.
With one one anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the <unk> principle, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and that is studies all that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
Over time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> bricks and time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties do not explain in terms of any basic terms.
Instead, it becomes fundamental -- and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental fundamental concepts -- time, mass law, mass law, <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are going on.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- time -- time, mass, <unk> then because of logic -- you have the <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- space, time, the mass processes.
And physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can see it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans -- dogs, mice, <unk> even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think about "Oh, it's always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling -- you know, some <unk> precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is really critical.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's a lot less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that will address the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There are always information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness is complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple <unk>
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> <unk>
It has a mathematical measure of information integration -- which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse is a degree of integration integration of information, just as significant as a very significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the cities, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
In fact, it provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality behind us.
How did Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get a lot hungry.
I think this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical terms and <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, right now we have a collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this full group of TED, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that at least is a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how are those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night in the morning.
But I think we finally will find that to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile. It had a low profile of education.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for an award for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an opposite problem.
She actually didn't get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an underwater profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. How a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a high school school in <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the middle of the 11 minutes -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
And I said, "What about <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When the people in the wheels, they talk about things that were <unk> at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had some experience with people with disability to disabled objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage, I think I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to <unk> Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lied to disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is something -- <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability is a fantastic thing.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you've seen one of the girl with no hands with a pencil held through the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we will get a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we had a benefit of people who have no disability.
And the purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, because of bad it is my life, could be worse.
I could be that one person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> saying that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was stuck in my morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those <unk> images of people with disability to people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
Some things.
But the things we communicate is not the things that you can think of.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of society that we live with because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair enough in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of a lie, because we've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery battery battery battery battery battery battery piano.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a stretch of stairs has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.   Oh, <unk> to a television screen will not be going to show the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a 11 boy at 11 grade school at a school high school school is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a wheelchair.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about it: <unk> thinks in <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way of being in the field is that I try to be <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that you feel like a <unk> man 110 <unk> trying to play it with everything else.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's get some videos to show you what the Google is to use <unk> under the helmet, give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up on the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few of them would take a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the field of football, from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> <unk>
Blue Blue Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being your favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball in the bottom of the network?
What is your experience when you move from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they were <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not actually <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick review of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group and you see the next thing you have shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties, you would tell you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium, you have a view from the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know about it.
The bad ones will have <unk> information.
This is going to give the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just to nerds.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the field <unk>
They ran the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you will be <unk> Normally, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They would take the area of protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open receptor.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can land, though, the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> and the fans have continued to do it from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive excitement on the game.
Let me make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
You want to be in the field of <unk>
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad it is your actions from the <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how lives are being <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face is, we face, as long as we do.
Thank you.
I recently became <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I was looking at the southern end of the <unk> county that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful San Francisco San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who had to build the bridge, he said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it comes to you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one free of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact is breaking off the bones, some of which we make vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The fact that no, they are usually <unk> in the water and then they were <unk>
I don't think that those who are <unk> this method of suicide is to realize the death of the <unk> <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are for before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this photo last year while this young man was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have a formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government to the <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at March 22 last year when they got a call from a suicide suicide bomber sitting in the cords near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to Jason to a <unk> officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up until two times since New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
From her <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> he leaned on the right, and they did.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken her life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had had it.
<unk> damage to a lot of people.
And I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone else would be <unk>
What about <unk>
<unk> what about that?
In my experience, I don't just talk to talk, but you need to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels, because you probably don't know it.
You just be there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to kill their life, you've had these <unk>
They go to the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do the <unk> social isolation, and a lost lost in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he was with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but at noticing more moments of realization that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the game of 49 with his father at the <unk>
He never got there.
I called the police police, and I would read it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness it had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be that easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and travel the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a <unk> subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I got my hair on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed immediately, the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for his account that day will come back about that lane go back to the other opportunity.
When Kevin turned out, I was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did, and they gave the hope to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase 9/11 events, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I only had six months completely unconscious from all those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General Hospital in San Francisco that night, you would get the patient.
I knew I had to get it <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
Poetry is not just something I found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, theft is the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've answered, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I have only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
And during that time, I had my hand at three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge are not <unk>
In addition, these few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one of those people have said to the second that they leave side of the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be <unk>
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not from, but inside you know what you are, and a question: How do you tell you about that?
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model, I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth, with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, that I will go over later, when I look at this picture -- I think, you managed to get it <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all shook our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> limitations of the color of the skin or the belief that they are around us.
They're people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my own agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines at my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom was like, "Why are you going to have that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a bit more complex and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I never loved me to share my story, not because I thought I will be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who asked me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that beautiful woman came to me in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something like me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a beauty for <unk>
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk>
He told me that if she was <unk> she was because of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> And the night, and that night, he won in <unk> I won on <unk> and she was a third finalist between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was about Queen of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my request on the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you tell the U.S. -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I wrote two <unk> to my name.
She also joined me when I was taught in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries do very sophisticated sophisticated surgery.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at license license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived in his truth, but he <unk> her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20, we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and stood in to injustice.
These are Captain P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. <unk> <unk> <unk> all my <unk>
I support my own service, and my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and they told me that their parents could not accept it, and I took the phone, and he would take my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it was not. It's not just identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us was assigned to a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table -- the theme that sometimes that task is not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
I should have space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many societies and tribal societies -- the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who meet her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his education campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when they took their efforts in 2011, and the <unk> <unk> <unk> was very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born, a girl, his birth is not <unk>
He's not sick, nor for his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives your <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was very excited to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, <unk> <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only human mother, but the daughter. The daughter was newly <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school admits of their brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, in some way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you ask him to go out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that assumption honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, and it's not only affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and her mother and people's decisions even if you don't want to.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same honor of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was going, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I grabbed a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was there, when she was four and a half years old, I was in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I must <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the child life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of Canadian <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters nor her daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends were going to see me.
He started to go with me to all different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hold it in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the economic and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> -- and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up through the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the NASA blog that was offered her herself for New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and October nine of 2012, was fired to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he was terrified of her ear to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was born, I was in the hospital and he had severe concert headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get it right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we got <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when you don't get his task.
They are fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and, from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering one.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about science science -- I made it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you to a brain operation.
They're still being like intelligent or not?
It's not going to be like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the middle of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mixing of chemicals, and try to encourage them to follow life.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to get the dose to try to get the <unk> dose because there is really no longer a map that will tell you in <unk>
I started to test with <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dramatically dramatic dose -- my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case -- for a few months, I tried a dose and classic chemicals for a man of evidence, and I was surprised to see how I was doing my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to <unk> Since then I've been doing better with men.
What I was trying to do was we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and others, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk> of ideas.
I think about almost always in images, and that became my key reference point to how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> and new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the brain works, for me is a simple one, for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to thinking about, and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I have lots of great mental <unk> you really have a very sophisticated mental <unk> really sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used technology, MRI technology, image <unk> to represent the brain. And you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that individual while they were looking at the same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the center of the left, and you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos as their brains were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions in front of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images with new people, new animals, and as long as they took a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information, the scanning information -- to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create the same picture, the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of larger resolution available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
And many of them are proposing new techniques to projection through images, even I am, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask why this technology is going to be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get larger resolution is with larger, but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> magnets -- let's make better magnets out.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most recent advances in <unk> of bright and bright and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and radio receivers in the MRI systems.
In turn, instead of a magnetic field in a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic patterns.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio radio processing, we can increase the <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our rising knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid fluid but the <unk> and <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity.
Will we be able to transform our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options that open this door.
Anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just of the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet might be telling some person for the first time that the love loves or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have through life in life.
Everything is a difficult conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> from my short <unk> and I had <unk> my head was a little bit -- I would say, usually a kid said, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself the next time I would say something.
He would have this hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time he was prepared and was about to come up with the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
And so I would take it deep and I went down and I went down to my back and my back, a four-year-old girl with a pink, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I would take a lot of a minute, again, I set up <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a boy, and I was a girl, and I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a little <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite drama is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all of it, like, "Oh, yeah, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation than ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like living in a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why it comes out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of it, but this is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared it on a broken bank -- it's harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell is harder than telling your five years you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult, there's only a hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is hard to do with what difficult to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make you feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse, which was a horse, and a <unk> dressed <unk>
It was not the militant lesbian to fight any four-year-old who would fit the coffee.
I was frozen down by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and the move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by a long time, but if you don't release that <unk> you kill.
One of my most memorable wheel was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many people knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> of honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my friends were in my parents, people who were known to me a few years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women stood up to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show, Will Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I expected to show you desperately about his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses his husband <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
That's how hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves getting out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be <unk>
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never happen for that.
And some of them can come out and be injured by what they've done, but never I'm sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet looking at a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical criticism of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, you know, a program to try to understand the underlying fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a virtual race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of Earth or intelligence on Earth, but they have amazing telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet that they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues across science, through many disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately correlated for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of the universal states, that we will embrace the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> planning, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks.
And so, by taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for a number of years, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending future, future <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
We would have the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have to have more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in the long time in any system where you find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, to play human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it didn't have to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here -- here we see a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Furthermore, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see some new connections to new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the best net net.
This same <unk> capacity also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> and organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend on the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense issues and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of negotiation negotiation -- successfully by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management ability will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> play, there was always the concept that if you had intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion there would be a <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then you get them to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly to take control, instead of being backwards.
Another important implication is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how is it that seeking goals to be learned from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, to help them understand human intelligence -- it's the following: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a turning point in human history, something between the identities of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what's pointing to the Earth is only one of the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that goes away.
The data gathered for Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their star.
So in together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their anger.
At the same time, this figures out clues about these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of very potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 was the <unk>
<unk> and ice ice that has been with us for the millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on on a global scale has <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist at the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better -- from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated that by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been livable in the past and part of it, that we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> trace their surface into search of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> <unk> take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and trying to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> they remind us to deserts on our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain in <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most primitive, and more <unk> of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will tap into a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity to humanity is like imagine the captain of the Titanic is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will be later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of saying, preserve and improving life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can actually meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the Enrico Fermi Fermi Fermi said, "I said, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to be able to keep living in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets that are <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, colonization, will save us from ourselves, but human preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to identify the hostile environments to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And while I was on the front porch and looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were really cool.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff <unk> to spend night because I had a flight early to Europe in the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but you sure don't more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I was going to be done.
I'm a career, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> the heart rate -- <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was <unk> that was bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen to you, you know, the probability of it is a total of a profit.
So I started thinking about that, but to a month later, my thoughts didn't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him about the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years ago, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
At the house, we would get a place for the things that are lost easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to get track of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the people live in the living trees, where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, reading glasses and <unk>
So at home, I would get a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For their passport, a particular tricks.
For your reading glasses -- a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all the time you are going to be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone, a picture of your credit card cards leave the drive, passport, it will go through yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
